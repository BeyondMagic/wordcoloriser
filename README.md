# wordcolorizer

An hour project.

Serves to colorise a text, the repeated lines will have the same colour.

As examples, using [iris](https://github.com/iris-cli/iris):

<img align="center" src="/.github/preview_2.png">

May serve as well for poems, I guess.

Doesn't serve for any too many utilities, it is simply a slighter cuter way to read lyrics, I guess.
